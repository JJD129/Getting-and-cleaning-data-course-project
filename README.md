# Getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data collection and data cleaning. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

In this repo: 

1) tidy data
2) run_analysis script 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
